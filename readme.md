# Library Management System

## Overview

This is a **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** application designed to manage a library system. The system includes features to manage books, authors, and borrowing processes. Users can borrow and return books, while administrators can manage the library catalog.

---

## Features

### 1. **User Management**
- User registration with email and password confirmation.
- JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- Separate permissions for admin users and normal users:
  - Admins can create, update, and delete books and authors.
  - Users can borrow and return books.

### 2. **Library Management**
- CRUD operations for:
  - Authors.
  - Books.
- Search and filter functionality for books by:
  - Title (search).
  - Author (filter).

### 3. **Borrowing System**
- Users can:
  - Borrow a book (if available).
  - Return a borrowed book.
  - View the list of books they have borrowed.
- Automatic handling of book availability:
  - Decrement available copies when a book is borrowed.
  - Increment available copies when a book is returned.

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
